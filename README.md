function recordMaker (name, address, phoneNumber, age, wombat) {
  console.log(name + " is " + age + "years old, and lives at " + address);
  if (wombat) {
    console.log("Calling " + name + " at " + phoneNumber + " about their wombat");
  } else {
    console.log(name + " doesn't have a wombat");
  }
